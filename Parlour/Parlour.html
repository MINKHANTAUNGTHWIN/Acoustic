            A parlor guitar is a compact and narrow-waisted instrument, generally smaller than Martin's single 0 size. The name comes from the rooms in which 
            the guitar was typically played in the late 19th century. Today, parlor guitars are finding renewed interest among a broad spectrum of players, 
            both professionals and those looking for small, lightweight instruments to take to beach parties or campfire singalongs. In this Acoustic Guitar 
            magazine guide to parlor guitars, you'll find:
            In 2013, in the zero-gravity atmosphere of outer space, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield made history when he reached for a floating Larrivée parlor 
            guitar to perform the early David Bowie hit “Space Oddity” for a video clip captured live from the International Space Station. The video went viral—and 
            Larrivée got the best publicity the solar system had ever seen.

            Back on Earth, interest in small-bodied parlor guitars—precursors to the bulky modern dreadnought—skyrocketed. At the 2015 Winter NAMM music retailers 
            convention in Anaheim, California, a steady stream of curious guitarists strolled past the Santa Cruz Guitar Co.'s impressive line of stalwart 
            dreadnoughts to ogle a diminutive PJ model tucked away into a crook in the manufacturer's exhibit booth.

            “The smallest guitar that we make today was one of the biggest guitars available up until about 1870,” Santa Cruz owner Richard Hoover says. “The only 
            reason they didn't make larger guitars [in the old days] is that they didn't need to. More volume wasn't an issue until people started competing with 
            other instruments in ensembles, or with barking dogs and banjos in vaudeville.”

            Hoover says that today, advances in amplification and recording have rendered larger guitars less essential, resulting in the current parlor guitar 
            craze. “In the early 1980s, interest in smaller instruments began a steady incline because people realized they didn't need the volume of the 
            dreadnought,” Hoover says. “In 1985, probably 70 percent of our guitars were dreadnoughts. Today, the majority of the instruments we make are OM, 
            00 size, or smaller, as more people appreciate the quality of the volume over the quantity.”

            Santa Cruz isn't the only company experiencing growth in its sales of small-bodied instruments. In 2013, Gretsch added the low-cost G9515 Jim Dandy 
            Flat Top model to its Roots Collection and parlor guitars were in evidence everywhere on the exhibit floor at the 2013 NAMM music-trade show in Anaheim, 
            California.
