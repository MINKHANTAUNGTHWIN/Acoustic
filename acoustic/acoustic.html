                Acoustic Guitar
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the string family. When a string is plucked, its
                vibration is
                transmitted from the bridge, resonating throughout
                the top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating
                through the
                air in the body, and producing sound from the
                sound hole.[1] The original, general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, and the retronym
                'acoustic
                guitar' distinguishes it from an electric guitar,
                which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the
                top side
                serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration
                sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings[2] are tuned (low to high) E2 A2
                D3 G3 B3
                E4.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick (plectrum) or fingertip, or strummed to play
                chords.
                Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a
                fundamental pitch determined by the string's length, mass, and tension. (Overtones are also present,
                closely
                related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch.)
                The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As these have
                their own
                resonances, they amplify some overtones more
                strongly than others, affecting the timbre of the resulting sound.

            <p>
                The guitar likely originated in Spain in the early 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina.[3] Gitterns, 
                (small, plucked guitars) were the first small, guitar-like instruments created during the Spanish Middle Ages with 
                a round back, like that of the lute.[4] Modern guitar-shaped instruments were not seen until the Renaissance era, 
                when the body and size began to take a guitar-like shape.
            </p>

            <p>
                The earliest string instruments related to the guitar and its structure were broadly known as vihuelas within Spanish 
                musical culture. Vihuelas were string instruments that were commonly seen in the 16th century during the Renaissance. 
                Later, Spanish writers distinguished these instruments into two categories of vihuelas. The vihuela de arco was an 
                instrument that mimicked the violin, and the vihuela de Penola was played with a plectrum or by hand. When it was played 
                by hand it was known as the vihuela de mano. Vihuela de mano shared extreme similarities with the Renaissance guitar as 
                it used hand movement at the sound hole or sound chamber of the instrument to create music.[5]
            </p>

            <p>
                By 1790 only six-course vihuela guitars (six unison-tuned pairs of strings) were being created and had become the main 
                type and model of guitar used in Spain. Most of the older 5-course guitars were still in use but were also being modified 
                to a six-coursed acoustical guitar. Fernando Ferandiere's[6] book Arte de tocar la Guitarra Española por Música (Madrid,
                1799) describes the standard Spanish guitar from his time as an instrument with seventeen frets and six courses with the 
                first two 'gut'strings tuned in unison called the terceras and the tuning named to 'G' of the two strings. The acoustic 
                guitar at this time began to take the shape familiar in the modern acoustic guitar. The coursed pairs of strings 
                eventually became less common in favor of single strings.[7]

                Finally, circa 1850, the form and structure of the modern guitar are credited to Spanish guitar maker Antonio Torres 
                Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and made use of fan bracing, which first 
                appeared in guitars made by Francisco Sanguino in the late 18th century. The bracing pattern, which refers to the 
                internal pattern of wood reinforcements used to secure the guitar's top and back to prevent the instrument from 
                collapsing under tension,[8] is an important factor in how the guitar sounds. Torres' design greatly improved the 
                volume, tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially unchanged since.

            <p>
                The acoustic guitar's soundboard, or top, also has a strong effect on the loudness of the guitar. Woods that are good 
                at transmitting sound, like spruce, are commonly used for the soundboard.[9] No amplification occurs in this process, 
                because musicians add no external energy to increase the loudness of the sound (as would be the case with an electronic 
                amplifier). All the energy is provided by the plucking of the string. Without a soundboard, however, the string would 
                just "cut" through the air without moving it much. The soundboard increases the surface of the vibrating area in a 
                process called mechanical impedance matching. The soundboard can move the air much more easily than the string alone, 
                because it is large and flat. This increases the entire system's energy transfer efficiency, and musicians emit a much 
                louder sound.
                
                <p>
                    In addition, the acoustic guitar has a hollow body, and an additional coupling and resonance effect 
                increases the efficiency of energy transmission in lower frequencies. The air in a guitar's cavity resonates with the 
                vibrational modes of the string and soundboard. At low frequencies, which depend on the size of the box, the chamber acts 
                like a Helmholtz resonator, increasing or decreasing the volume of the sound again depending on whether the air in the box 
                moves in phase or out of phase with the strings. When in phase, the sound increases by about 3 decibels. In opposing phase, 
                it decreases about 3 decibels.[10] As a Helmholtz resonator, the air at the opening is vibrating in or out of phase with the 
                air in the box and in or out of phase with the strings. These resonance interactions attenuate or amplify the sound at different 
                frequencies, boosting or damping various harmonic tones. Ultimately, the cavity air vibrations couple to the outside air through 
                the sound hole,[11] though some[which?] variants of the acoustic guitar omit this hole, or have f holes, like a violin 
                family instrument (a trait found in some electric guitars such as the ES-335 and ES-175 models from Gibson). This coupling 
                is most efficient because here the impedance matching is perfect: it is air pushing air.

            <p>
                A guitar has several sound coupling modes: string to soundboard, soundboard to cavity air, and both soundboard and cavity air 
                to outside air. The back of the guitar also vibrates to some degree, driven by air in the cavity and mechanical coupling to the 
                rest of the guitar. The guitar—as an acoustic system—colors the sound by the way it generates and emphasizes harmonics, and how 
                it couples this energy to the surrounding air (which ultimately is what we perceive as loudness). Improved coupling, however, 
                comes costing decay time, since the string's energy is more efficiently transmitted. Solid body electric guitars (with no 
                soundboard at all) produce very low volume, but tend to have long sustain.All these complex air coupling interactions, and 
                the resonant properties of the panels themselves, are a key reason that different guitars have different tonal qualities. 
                The sound is a complex mixture of harmonics that give the guitar its distinctive sound.
